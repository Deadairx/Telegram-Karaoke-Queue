# Documentation
If you need to get documentation for details on how to use something, ask me
what info you need and steps on how I may find it. I will reply with
documentation fragments related to what you need. Wait for me to provide the
documentation fragments.

# Adding dependencies
When a dependency needs to be added to a project, use the cli command instead
of editing the dependency file directly so that we get the latest version.
(ex. running `cargo add <crate>` instead of editing `Cargo.toml`)
